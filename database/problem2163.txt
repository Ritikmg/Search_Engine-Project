b"You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i])."

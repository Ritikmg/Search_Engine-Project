b"Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property\xc2\xa0root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)\xc2\xa0always holds."

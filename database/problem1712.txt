b"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n\xc2\xa0vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1,\xc2\xa0and an array edges\xc2\xa0where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes\xc2\xa0ai\xc2\xa0and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles\xc2\xa0and with the minimum possible total edge weight."
